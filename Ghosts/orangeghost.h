     * ghost is in chase stage its target is calculated depending on a circle
     * around pacman with a radius 8. If the ghost is in that circle its target
     * is set to be pacman's position, if it is not inside target is set to X =
     * 0, Y = 30.
     * @param pacman Pacman against which the target is calculated.
